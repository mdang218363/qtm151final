    "Formula 1, or also known as F1, is the world's most popular motorsport racing circuit. The best drivers around the world sign with teams to compete, all with their own special cars and pit crews to give them a competitive edge. In order to get a better understanding of race times in F1, we decided to do our project on Time Analysis Tables. There are many variables that correlate to times, such as pit stop durations, time trends over different race events, and how times have improved over time due to technology and the sharpening of driver skill.
